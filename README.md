# Binary-to-Decimal-using-Recurrent-Neural-Network

Recurrent Neural Network is on the most effective neural network model. It considers the position of the sequential data. In this tutorial we are going to explore the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a practical example.


We are going to build a Binary to Decimal converter using RNN. We are going to build a RNN from scratch using python, no machine learning libraries are going to be used.
